# tech-salary-predictor
This is a machine learning project, exploring tech salaries through machine learning techniques. This project uses Stack Overflows 2023 data to predict the expected salary of an individual based on several criterias. It uses messy and large data that required lots of data cleaning and preparing to then use a linear regression model for prediction.
